/* Webhook 

  Stripe is an external system, and we want to integrate this external system with our application, in a way that when
  an event occurs, such as the payment being confirmed, we want to internally update our database and app. And to do this
  we have to create a route that will be called by stripe whenever the payment is confirmed, this file must be in this
  location

  inside the app, create an api folder, then place the stripe folder and file to be called

  This function name POST will make all the requets made to this file, as a post request, to target this function

  Summarize what we just did

  We created a checkout action inside the subscription/action folder, redirected the user to this checkout, and created a
  webhook the user will call when he concludes the payment, check if the type of event is invoice.paid, check if we are
  paying for this subscription plan, and updating the user in clerk.
