## Differences between a library and a framework

### Library

React is a library, a library specialized in creating UI interfaces. A library typycally has certain characteristics: it
focuses on doing one thing well, and takes a non-opiniated approach to how developers use it.

A non-opiniated approach means that, in a react application we have the freedom to build it however we want. For instance, 
we can use either function components, class components and structure our application according to our preferences

In summary, as a library, react provides flexibility and allow developers to choose how they want to implement the solutions

### Framework

On the other hand, a framework often combines on or more libraries to provide a more comprehensive solution that addresses
a wider range of challenges developers might encounter

A framework is generally more opiniated. For example, Next.js, unlike react, is a framework. It uses react, as a library,
to render the interface, but also includes additional features, like image optimization, fonts optimizatrion, server components, built-in data fetching mechanism, server actions, its own approach to implementing a middleware, and more.

Because of these features, Next.js offer a more complete solution by integrating multiple tools and functionalities into
a single package;
